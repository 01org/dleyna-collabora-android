Subject: [PATCH 4/9] utils: avoid redundant set/endpwent around getpwuid

set/endpwent are only required for iterating through passwd entries
using getpwent(). Since we are explicitly requesting a passwd entry for
a uid then the set/endpwent calls are redundant.

Removing these redundant calls is required for building on Android since
their C library doesn't implement these.
