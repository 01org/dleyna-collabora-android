| dLeyna in Android |
+-------------------+

This is (1) a collection of native libraries ported for use in Android
applications, (2) an Android application that runs various unit tests of the
native libraries, and (3) an Android application that demonstrates dLeyna
functionality.

Native Libraries
----------------

Dleyna depends directly or indirectly upon the following native libraries:

    gupnp-dlna
    gupnp-av
    gupnp
    gssdp
    libsoup
    libxml2
    glib (glib, gio, gmodule, gobject, gthread)
    gettext (libintl)
    iconv
    libffi

The remote locations of the library sources, the dependencies between them,
how to configure and build them are all described using JHBuild. See
modulesets/android-native.modules. The "standalone toolchain" from the Android
NDK is used to build the libraries.

A convenient script allows you to specify the target architecture (arm
or x86) and Android API level you want to build for, as well as the
version of the cross-compiler from the Android NDK to use:

    [ARCH=<arch>] [API_LEVEL=<level>] build.sh [<cmd>...]

where

    <arch>    is 'x86' or 'armeabi' (default 'x86')
    <level>   is an Android API level: 3,4,5,8,9, or 14 (default '9')
    <cmd>...  is a JHBuild command and args (default 'build libsoup') 

The result of the build will be left in a subdirectory named

    install-<arch>-android-<level>


Test Native Libraries
---------------------

This is an Android app that incorporates a large number of the unit tests
from the native libraries. It allows the user to select which tests to run,
the then sequentially runs them, each in a pristine process. While a test is
running, the user can abort it and skip to the next one, or abort all the
tests.
